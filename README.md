## Introduction
This project aims to classify emotions based on textual input. It uses several machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and model training and assessment, to achieve this.

## Dataset


The dataset for this project consists of textual data annotated with various emotions, divided into training and test sets for model evaluation.

Facial expression recognition research was conducted using the Facial Expression Recognition Challenge (FER2013) dataset.

One motivation for emphasizing representation learning is the ability of algorithms to autonomously engineer features more effectively and efficiently than manual human efforts. However, participation in this challenge does not mandate the use of representation learning. The dataset was specifically curated for facial expression classification and sourced from the internet.

Each grayscale portrait in the dataset measures 48x48 pixels and depicts a face. Faces are automatically aligned to maintain consistent positioning within each image, roughly centered and occupying a standardized area. The primary task is to categorize each face into one of seven emotion categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). In total, the dataset comprises 35,887 examples.


## Preprocessing

1. **Text Cleaning**: tokenization, stopword removal, and special character removal.
2. **Vectorization**: Using TF-IDF Vectorizer, text data is transformed into numerical format.
3. **PCA**: Principal Component Analysis is used to minimize the dimensionality of the data.
## Models

Several models are trained and evaluated in this project:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Naive Bayes**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
